If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out. 
Cocaine. 
If you wanna get down, down on the ground. 
Cocaine. 

[Chorus:] 
She doesn't lie, she doesn't lie, she doesn't lie; 
Cocaine. 

If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues. 
Cocaine. 
When your day is done and you wanna run. 
Cocaine. 

[Chorus] 

If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on. 
Cocaine. 
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back. 
Cocaine.
