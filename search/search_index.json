To apply the initial delay , the autoscroll waits until the eye-focus zone enters the middle of the screen. Then, it starts scrolling the song until the end of song is reached. Also, there is a count-down timer displayed before scrolling at the beginning of the song. You can interrupt the initial delay (initial countdown) by scrolling down manually. Then the scroll will be started immediately. On the other hand, if you scroll up manually while in countdown, the initial delay will be increased to give you more time. If the scrolling is too fast or too slow, you can adjust the scroll speed in settings or in autoscroll panel.

It contains the song's lyrics intertwined with the chords. The chords are placed between square brackets [ and ] , eg. [C7] . You must adhere to the formatting principles in order to create a valid song in Songbook . Formatting Rules \u00b6 Try to stick to these following rules in order to keep songs consistent with others: Mark chords by surrounding them with square brackets , e.g. [C]So, so you think you can [D]tell Mix chords with the lyrics in the same line , placing them just before the words where they occur in order to precisely indicate where a chord should be accentuated, e.g. Never gonna [G]give you [A]up Don't Do not place the chords on a separate line above the text . Note If you want to display chords above the lyrics, you can always change your Displaying Style in Settings . So don't force it on others, let others choose their favourite displaying style. Placing chords in the same line is extremely important, because only then chords are precisely defined in correct place, regardless different font styles or word wrapping . Don't worry about your favourite chords displaying style, Songbook will do all the magic for you. If some part of a song is repeated (e.g. chorus ), copy it to all its occurrences. When lyrics are continuous , it facilitates scrolling through the song and then you will not have to scroll back every time to see the refrain chords. Don't Don't put any superfluous annotations or paragraphs like Chorus , Verse , Title , Solo , Instrumental . Include only lyrics with chords. If a song has difficult rhythm with chords changing frequently , place the chords between words or even inside the words in order to indicate the syllable with a chord accent, e.g [G]Hotel Cali[D]fornia In very simple cases, it is allowed to place the chords at the end of line : Smoke on the water [C G#] You can use dash - to couple quickly changing chords: D Dsus2-D-Dsus4 or use parentheses () to mark some chords optional : [C G (G7)] . Make sure you have chosen appropriate Notation for your chords ( Am for English or a for German ). Find out why specifying Chord Notation is so important Use Reformat and Validate tools on your song before saving it, especially when you are going to publish it. Valid chords \u00b6 Please use the valid chord names inside brackets, so the Songbook can interpret them correctly. A chord name usually consists of two parts: main note : eg. C , C# , D , Db etc. chord variant : eg. add4 , m , maj7 , 7 , etc. or empty (simple major chord) Having that in mind, E minor chord, should be named Em (in English notation). Valid chords are for instance C G# A7 F#maj7 Don't Don't use Fm# name, the valid chord is F#m instead (F sharp minor). Note In some chord notations (like German ) minor chords are written with lowecase note names, eg. d (instead of English Dm ). Also, valid note names depend on a selected chord notation, eg. German notation have A B H C ... notes, while in English it's called A Bb B C ... . Example \u00b6 [C]Twinkle, twinkle, [F]little [C]star [F]How I [C]wonder [G7]what you [C]are. [C]Example [G#]text [C G# A7 F#maj7] [C]So, so you think you can [D]tell Smoke on the water [C G#] Never gonna [G]give you [A]up Never gonna [F#m]let you [Bm]down Never gonna [G]run [A]around and [F#]desert [Bm]you Never gonna [G]make you [A]cry Never gonna [F#m]say good[Bm]bye Never gonna [G]tell [A]a lie and [F#]hurt [Bm]you Utilities \u00b6 For your needs you can use comments by placing them between braces { and } , eg. {capo on 2 fret} , or {x2} . However it's discouraged to use the comments in the public songs. Try to get rid of them before publishing a song. Find out more about Chords Editor , which has a lot of useful tools. Importing songs \u00b6 In order to load a song to My songs , you can import it from a local file on your device or any cloud drive supported by your device (like Google Drive ). You can load either: text file ( .txt ), PDF document ( .pdf ) or Google Docs document. Note When importing a PDF file, the raw text will be extracted. Keep in mind that the extracted text might look different compared to original PDF, esepcially if it has non-flat structures inside, like tables or fancy paragraph layout. Editing with external tool \u00b6 If you prefer, you can use any external text editor to create and modify a song in a text file format. The text file should be saved with UTF-8 encoding. It can have arbitrary extension, but the common practice is to use .txt extension. Displaying style benefits \u00b6 Thanks to indicating precisely the place where the chord is accentuated (right before the word), Songbook can interpret that information in different ways when displaying a chord.

Songbook supports several chord notations: English - used in most countries. Names for the 12 notes: A , A# or Bb , B , C , C# or Db , D , D# or Eb , E , F , F# or Gb , G , G# or Ab Minor chords are denoted by appending m to the main note name (eg. Em ). German (#/b) - used in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden. Names for the 12 notes: A , A# or B , H , C , C# or Db , D , D# or Eb , E , F , F# or Gb , G , G# or Ab Minor chords are denoted by lowercase note name (eg. e is E minor ). German (is/es) - alternative German notation. Names for the 12 notes: A , Ais or B , H , C , Cis or Des , D , Dis or Es , E , F , Fis or Ges , G , Gis or As Minor chords are denoted by lowercase note name. Dutch - used in Netherlands, Indonesia. Names for the 12 notes: A , Ais or Bes , B , C , Cis or Des , D , Dis or Es , E , F , Fis or Ges , G , Gis or As Minor chords are denoted by appending m to the main note name. Japanese - used in Japan. Names for the 12 notes: I , Ei-i or Hen-ro , Ro , Ha , Ei-ha or Hen-ni , Ni , Ei-ni or Hen-ho , Ho , He , Ei-he or Hen-to , To , Ei-to or Hen-i Minor chords are denoted by appending m to the main note name. Solfege - used in Italy, France, Spain, Romania, Russia, Latin America, Greece, Israel, Turkey, Latvia. Names for the 12 notes: La , La# or Sib , Si , Do , Do# or Reb , Re , Re# or Mib , Mi , Fa , Fa# or Solb , Sol , Sol# or Lab Minor chords are denoted by appending m to the main note name. You can pick your favourite chord notation in the Settings. Default chord notation had already been set automatically depending on your system language since some chord notations are used only in particular countries. Note Name B in music can denote completely different notes depending on the chord notation. According to English notation B is the note being 1 semitone lower than C , while according to German notation it's the sound that is 2 semitones lower than C (so it's English Bb ). Thus, it's extremely important to specify the appropriate chord notation before interpreting chords. Note German chord notation changes note names to lowercase in case of a minor chord, eg. d (instead of English Dm ). Songbook takes that into account too. What's the difference between C# or Db? Basically, it depends on the key you're working on. In music, you don't mix sharps and flats in one song. Also, you avoid using the same note letter (with different modifiers ) more than once in the same scale in classical theory. For instance, F major key consists of notes: F , G , A , Bb (or A# ), C , D , E . It makes sense to write it with flats F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E , so each letter occurs only once. If you write it with sharps F, G, A, A#, C, D, E , you end up with A occurring twice (in 2 variants) and no B at all. It seems to be more wrong. Thus, it depends on the key context. Sometimes it's better to call it C# (eg. in D major key) and sometimes it makes more sense to call it Db (eg. in Ab / G# major key). Songbook takes that into account when displaying chords, once it detects a key .","title":"Chord Notations"},{"location":"chord-notations/#chord-notations","text":"Chord Notation is the note naming convention in music.
