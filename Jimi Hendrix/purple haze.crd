Purple haze all in my brain 
Lately things just don't seem the same 
Actin' funny, but I don't know why 
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky 

Purple haze all around 
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down 
Am I happy or in misery? 
Whatever it is that girl put a spell on me 

Purple haze all in my eyes 
Don't know if it's day or night 
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind 
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?
